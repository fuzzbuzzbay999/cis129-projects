# Not actually my first python script.
# For the sake of this course it is
# It ShoULD print a simple short story

import time
i=0
print('Hello, World')
print('if you are creating a file" + \n +"you dont have to commit after every line')
while True:
  print(i)
  i+=1
  if i>3000:
    break
print('much faster then java tho')
